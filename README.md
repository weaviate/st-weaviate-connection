# Streamlit-Weaviate Connection

[![Weaviate](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Built%20with&message=Weaviate&color=green&style=flat-square)](https://weaviate.io/) [![Weaviate](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%20made%20with%20%E2%9D%A4%20for&message=Streamlit&color=red&style=flat-square)](https://streamlit.io/)

This project provides a Streamlit connector for the open-source vector database, [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/).

## Overview

The Streamlit-Weaviate Connector enables developers to connect to a Weaviate database with the following Python code:

 ```python
    conn = st.connection(
        "weaviate",
        type=WeaviateConnection,
        url=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_URL"),
        api_key=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_KEY"),
    )
 ```

## Features

- Hybrid search functionality
- GraphQL query support
- Advanced operations using the Weaviate Python client
- Secrets management for secure connections

## 🔧 Installation

This project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/) for dependency management. To install:

1. Ensure you have Python >=3.11.0 installed
2. Install poetry: `pip install poetry`
3. Install the project: `poetry add git+https://github.com/weaviate/st-weaviate-connection.git`

## Usage

Check out the [demo notebook](./notebooks/01_demo.ipynb) for basic usage examples.

Before running, set these environment variables:
```
WEAVIATE_URL=YOUR_WEAVIATE_CLUSTER_URL
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=YOUR_WEAVIATE_API_KEY
```

## 🔗 Basic Usage

### Connecting to a Weaviate Cloud instance

To connect to a Weaviate Cloud instance, use the following code:

```python
conn = st.connection(
    "weaviate",
    type=WeaviateConnection,
    url=weaviate_url,
    api_key=weaviate_apikey,
    additional_headers={"X-OpenAI-Api-Key": openai_apikey},
)
```

Where `weaviate_url` and `weaviate_apikey` are the URL and API key of your Weaviate Cloud instance, respectively.

### Queries

You can use the `hybrid_search` method or `graphql_query` method to query your Weaviate instance.

To perform a hybrid search, use the following method:

```python
df = conn.hybrid_search(
    collection_name="<COLLECTION NAME>",
    query="<QUERY STRING>",
)
```

To perform a GraphQL `GET` query, use the following method:

```python
df = conn.graphql_query(
    """
    {
        Get {
            <YOUR QUERY GOES HERE>
        }
    }
    """
)
```

Both methods return a Pandas DataFrame.

#### `hybrid_search` method

The `hybrid_search` method is a convenience method that was created for the Weaviate connector.

It performs a hybrid search on the Weaviate instance. The method requires `collection_name` and `query` as arguments.

- `collection_name` : str
    - The name of the collection to query.
- `query` : str
    - The query to search for.

It also accepts `limit`, `filters`, `target_vectors`, `query_properties`, and `alpha` as optional arguments.

## Advanced Usage

The Weaviate connector uses the Weaviate Python client under-the-hood to interact with the Weaviate instance.

Accordingly, you can use the Weaviate client object directly to perform advanced operations.

We recommend using the following syntax:

```python
with conn.client() as client:
    # Use the client object to perform required operations
    # e.g. 1: Create a collection
    # client.collections.create(...)
    #
    # e.g. 2: Perform retrieval augmented generation & print the generated recommendation
    # collection = client.collections.get(...)
    # response = collection.generate.hybrid(
    #     limit=4,
    #     query="a sweet european red wine",
    #     grouped_task="From these, recommend a wine that would pair well with a steak",
    # )
    #
    # print("## Generated recommendation")
    # print(response.generated)
    ...
```

This way, the client will also automatically close the connection after the block is executed, ensuring that there are no resource leaks.

## Example notebook

The project includes a demonstration notebook to showcase basic functionalities of the connector (see here [demo notebook](./notebooks/01_demo.ipynb))

Before you run the Jupyter notebook make sure that you have set the following environment variables

**Set environment variables:**
```
WEAVIATE_URL=<YOUR WEAVIATE CLOUD INSTANCE URL>
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=<YOUR WEAVIATE CLOUD INSTANCE API KEY>
```

## 📚 Documentation

All connector functionality can be found in the [`connection.py`](./st_weaviate_connection/connection.py) python file. Documentation about `st.connection` can be found [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/connections/st.experimental_connection).
